This is my homepage for some of my completed (web) development projects.

I am learning web-dev to enable me to make various pet projects, as well as to add tools to my toolbox of skills for data analysis and other ventures :)

## Completed projects

#### Podcast "archiver" using Flask

[Live build](https://pod-archiver.onrender.com/) (hosted on Render, may take a minute to load).

This is a web app via which the user may search for and add podcasts to selection (the search uses iTunes API) or add manually via RSS link. The episodes from the selected podcasts are then displayed. You may click on the title to view the episode summary, play the audio, and download a .csv of your episodes.

I used a Flask (Python) backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend. This was my first project using JS to this extent, and as such, there are some ineffeciencies I would alleviate.

If I had to do it over again, I would:
- Use a flex layout for consistency and mobile-compatibility. I was just beginning to learn css and it is messy here
- Be more consistent with my JS methods and variable declarations
